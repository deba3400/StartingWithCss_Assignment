BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier, and it is a naming convention for writing CSS class names in a clear, modular, and consistent way. BEM is particularly useful in large-scale projects where maintaining a predictable and scalable codebase is essential.

Here's a breakdown of the BEM naming convention:

1. **Block:**
   - A standalone entity that is a meaningful and independent component of the page. It serves as a container for elements and is named with a class that describes its purpose.

     ```css
     .block {
       /* styles for the block */
     }
     ```

2. **Element:**
   - A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to the block. Elements are named by concatenating the block name and the element name with a double underscore (`__`).

     ```css
     .block__element {
       /* styles for the element */
     }
     ```

3. **Modifier:**
   - A flag that modifies the style or behavior of a block or element. Modifiers are named by concatenating the block or element name with the modifier name using a double dash (`--`).

     ```css
     .block--modifier {
       /* styles for the block with the modifier */
     }

     .block__element--modifier {
       /* styles for the element with the modifier */
     }
     ```
